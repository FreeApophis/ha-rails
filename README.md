# ha-rails

House Automation Website in Rails for Raspberry Pi

Feel free to use any code, but currently this project will not be very generic, and is tailored to my personal needs. Because simply put, there are no simple HA Websites out there.

## Installation

bundle install

rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rake assets:precompile
